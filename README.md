## ***SAL_BW_Project_1*** 
## ***Assignment: Web Scraping, SQL Insights, and Data Visualization***  


### **Project Objective** 
* To scrape book data from the website (http://books.toscrape.com/)
* Save the data in a CSV file
* Generate SQL insights using MySQL
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization using Python.

 ### **Technologies Used**
Python (for Web Scraping & Data Cleaning, Data Visualizatio)
MySQL (for Data Storage & Querying)



### **Project Stages**
## Stage 1: Scraping and Storing Raw Data

* Scraped from http://books.toscrape.com/ 
* Stored the raw data in bigbasket.csv for further processing.

### **Walkthrough (Video)**

   
  2. Store the data in a CSV file with columns:
 
    ```
    title, price, availability, rating
    
    ```
3. Ensure that all pages are scraped, not just the first one.


### **Part 2: SQL Insights**

After scraping and saving the data, load it into a SQL database and answer the following questions:

1. **Find the number of books available in stock.**
2. **List the top 5 most expensive books.**
3. **Find the average rating of books.**
4. **Retrieve the total number of books for each rating (e.g., 1-star, 2-star, etc.).**

**Example Insights (For Reference)**

- There are **X** books available in stock.
- The most expensive book is **"XYZ"**, priced at **Â£59.99**.
- The average rating of books is **4.2 stars**.
- There are **Y** books with a **5-star** rating.



  
### **Project Outcome**
1. Successfully extracted website.
2. Stored and managed data efficiently in MySQL.
3. Built an insightful Data Visualization for comparative analysis.
