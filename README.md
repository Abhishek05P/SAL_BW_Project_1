### **Assignment: Web Scraping, SQL Insights, and Data Visualization**  



## **Problem Statement**
### **Objective** 
* In this assignment, you will scrape book data from the website [**Books to Scrape**](http://books.toscrape.com/), save the data in a CSV file, generate insights using SQL, and then perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization using Python.

### **Part 1: Web Scraping (Using Python)**

1. Scrape the website [**http://books.toscrape.com/**](http://books.toscrape.com/) and extract the following details for each book:
    - **Title**
    - **Price**
    - **Availability**
    - **Rating (out of 5 stars)**
   
  2. Store the data in a CSV file with columns:
 
    ```
    title, price, availability, rating
    
    ```
3. Ensure that all pages are scraped, not just the first one.


### **Part 2: SQL Insights**

After scraping and saving the data, load it into a SQL database and answer the following questions:

1. **Find the number of books available in stock.**
2. **List the top 5 most expensive books.**
3. **Find the average rating of books.**
4. **Retrieve the total number of books for each rating (e.g., 1-star, 2-star, etc.).**

**Example Insights (For Reference)**

- There are **X** books available in stock.
- The most expensive book is **"XYZ"**, priced at **Â£59.99**.
- The average rating of books is **4.2 stars**.
- There are **Y** books with a **5-star** rating.


### **Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization**

Using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, perform the following:

1. **Basic EDA**
    - Load the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - Display basic statistics about the dataset (e.g., number of books, average price, missing values, etc.).
2. **Data Visualization**
    - **Bar chart** of the number of books for each rating (1 to 5 stars).
    - **Histogram** showing the distribution of book prices.
    - **Pie chart** representing the proportion of books in stock vs. out of stock.
    - Any other creative visualization that helps understand the dataset.
